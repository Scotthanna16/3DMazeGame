## MazeAppByScottHanna
This maze app was a project for my software development class. Sadly the class has now gone away from this project, which is too bad because although it was a giant pain in the ass, I learned a lot by completing it. There are multiple parts to this project. The first was implementing the Boruvka graph algorithm in order to build the maze. Second, we created 2 computer players that solved the maze for the player. Finally we refactored the java application to an android app and customized the theme. I took this class my sophomore year, when I was very new to programming so it is not perfect, but I am proud of it and put a lot of hours into it. Finally it should be noted that a lot of this code was not written by myself. It was instead refactored by my Professor, from some other source, for educational purposes, that being said, I think it is noted appropriately when that is the case.
